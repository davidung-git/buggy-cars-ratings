# Buggy Cars Rating 

UI Automation using Cypress framework and Typescript for BuggyCars test site. 

## Test Approach: 

I decided to do some exploratory testing on the BuggyCars website in order to get a better understanding on the purpose of the site. This allowed me to work out the core functionalities as well as the main use cases which I expect the average user would do. 


## Installation: 

Navigate to where the project is located in terminal then run:

``` 
npm install 
```

## Test Runner:

To run in headless electron: 
```
npx cypress run
```

To run in headless chrome/firefox: 
```
npx cypress run --browser {browsername}
```

To run in headed mode: 
```
npx cypress run --headed
```
